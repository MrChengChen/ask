                        <h4>Former Admissions Officer at MIT, Harvard, Michigan</h4>
                        <hr />
                    </div>
                    <p>Many - but not all - colleges are trying to figure out just how interested a student might be in attending their college. <mark>When an admissions committee can't admit everyone, it is helpful to have some sense of the seriousness which which a student might consider an offer of admission.</mark></p>
                    <p>Meaningful contacts are ones in which the student learns about the school (which the colleges hope will make the student even more intersted) and/or ones that show a student's sincere interest in the institution. For instance, visiting a college is one of the best ways to learn about a college. Similarly, interviewing on campus or signing up for an interview with an alumnus/a in a student's area (assuming interviews are available) are great ways to experience an institution and/or engage with someone from the community in a meaningful way. During those interviews, students can ask questions, learn great information, and start to get a sense as to whether or not the college may be the right fit for her/him.</p>
                    <p>If a student can't get on campus or if interviews aren't available, perhaps having a substantive conversation with a college representative at a college fair or reaching out to an admissions officer via email to ask serious questions (after one has done a little bit of his/her own homework on the school) would be a good idea. Sometimes colleges offer Skype interviews if distance or cost prohibit a campus visit. Or, social media or other modern technology offer opportunities to engage with admissions bloggers or other current students.</p>
                    <p>The point is that talking with someone in the admissions office can be really important when conduct one's search and trying to figure out what colleges would be a great fit academically, extracurricularly, and financially.</p>
                    <p>Please note, though, that college admissions officers generally don't want students to contact them if they don't have real questions to ask. There is a line to walk between contacting a college/talking to a college's representative and contacting/talking to that person too much or without a real reason to do so.</p>
                    <p>One final note: if a student would apply to a college and be deferred (meaning that the admissions office wants to wait a little bit before making a final decision on the student's application), it is imperative that the student reach out to the admissions office to express a continued interest in being considered for admission. Responding graciously and maturely after a deferral is yet another important way to have meaningful contact with an admissions officer.</p>

                        <h3><strong>By Trevor R</strong></h3>

                        <hr />
                    </div>
                    <p>Addressing a low GPA can be tricky. If something was happening in your life that negatively impacted your GPA, it may be important share this information with the admission committee in the "additional information" section of an application (or as an addendum to your application or in an interview). However, just because your GPA is lower does not automatically mean you should talk about it.</p>
                    <p><mark>Whether or not you address the situation can depend on a lot of circumstances. Was there something happening in a particular semester/year, and were your grades clearly lower during that time period? If yes to both, then</mark> you probably want to address it. Sometimes students will have something happen in a particular semester, but their grades remained consistently average. In this scenario, it is difficult to address the lower GPA because there is no noticeable change.</p>
                    <p>The types of situations that are commonly shared on an application include (but are not limited to) a parental divorce, death in the family, bullying, learning disability, medical problem, or taking a class for which you did not have the adequate prerequisites. Admission officers realize that teenagers have a lot on their plates and sometimes there are things outside of their control that can impact academic performance. If you encountered a situation like this, you should definitely address it.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not you have encountered a situation like this, the difficulty with addressing poor grades, is that you don’t want to sound like you are making excuses. It is important to take responsibility for your academic standing while also shedding light on the additional circumstances.</p>
                    <p>If your GPA is lower because you were not doing your homework or putting in the necessary effort, this is difficult to address. Here is the good news: it is not too late to start working hard right now. Your goal should be to knock your senior year grades out of the park and finish with your best academic performance ever. You can also help your chances for admission with strong standardized test results. Admission officers are not cold-hearted people who are looking to deny every student. They want to find reasons to admit students, so go out there and give them a reason by getting it done in the classroom.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, as a senior, you may not be able to "right the ship" in time to receive serious consideration at the ultra-selective colleges or universities (those that are admitting less than 20% of their applicants). However, those colleges make up less than 1% of the colleges, universities, and degree granting institutions in the United States. The overwhelming majority of colleges or universities (which includes countless numbers of outstanding institutions) will gladly admit a student with an average overall GPA and a positive trend in their grades (and/or a strong standardized test result).</p>
                    <p>Therefore it is also important to be honest about your chances for admission. You can still apply to a couple ultra-selective institutions, but make sure you have a wise application strategy that includes a handful of colleges where you have a stronger chance for admissions. If you are looking for some of those colleges, check out the website Colleges That Change Lives as well as any number of the outstanding state institutions across the country that do not fit into the ultra-selective category.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In general, the best applications unfold, with each aspect (transcript, recommendations, activities, essays) adding something new to your application. In some cases, that can be different views of one aspect of your life--for example, a musician who writes one essay about mastering a difficult piece, and another about learning how to teach another person how to play. This would be the same theme, but each essay would have a different impact. Or, if your "I want to go to your college because..." essay is about the superb scientific opportunities at the college, and your essay is about your first experience with lab research, that is fine too.</p>
                    <p><mark>Try to stay away from deliberately hammering away at just one aspect of yourself, though. Very often, students who had heard "you need a hook to get in to college" would try to create a hook</mark> for themselves by relentlessly promoting one achievement. More often than not, this would backfire because other parts of the application were more interesting to the committee, but there wasn't information there about anything but the self-selected hook. The more aspects of yourself you are able to highlight, the more opportunities you have to connect with various members of the admissions committee.</p>

                    <p>A few thoughts:</p>
                    <p>Think of the essay as an opportunity to add something different/unique to your application, aside from your grades, test scores, activities, honors, etc. Try not to repeat information that can already be gleaned from elsewhere in the application. If you are elaborating on a particular activity or academic goal, describe a particular aspect or instance that one might not have considered from assessing your transcript or activities list.</p>
                    <p>Have a story to tell about your background, your personality, your goals, your growth and development? Great! Any anecdotal information you can write about will capture the admission officer’s attention and lend texture to your application.
                        Brainstorm ideas, write an outline, use bullet points, then write a rough draft. Get your top ideas down on paper, then write the essay around them. It makes the process a little less daunting than feeling you need to sit down and write an entire essay from scratch.</p>
                    <p>Edit, edit, edit! Don’t just write one draft and think it’s finished. Show it to people you trust, get their opinions, then go back and make changes. This should be a process of personal discovery as well as an effort in writing a succinct, grammatically correct, informational, and interesting composition.</p>
                    <p>Answer the question asked! Don’t think that "One essay fits all." Different essay questions require different responses.</p>

                    <p>These tips are mostly geared towards students interested in applying to very selective colleges, but I think that they can be of use to everyone.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Limit the number of reach schools on your list!</strong></p>
                            <p><mark>I personally think that you should limit the number of schools you apply to with acceptance rates under 15%. I know that some people apply to all eight ivies hoping that they will get into at least one. I understand where these people are coming from, but</mark> I do not think that this is a good strategy for a few reasons. 1) There is no way you are in love with all eight ivies. They have distinct personalities. 2) Think of the number of essays you will have to write. It is better to write three good essays than 10 mediocre ones. 3) Unless you are a transcendent student (by ivy league standards), chances are that you could end your senior year with many rejections. That is just disheartening.</p>
                            <p>As for me, I applied to five reach schools. Four were ivies. I was accepted to two of my reach schools and rejected by the other three. I do not think that five reach schools is a terrible number, but I would not do it again. I only applied to two of the ivies because of their prestigious names. I spent a lot of time on the applications, and then I was rejected in March! It just is not worth it. I would recommend 1-3 reach schools that you LOVE.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Craft your college application list as if the reach schools did not exist.</strong></p>
                            <p>This is something I did, and I would recommend this tip to everyone. Select your 1-3 reach schools, and then forget about them. Assume that you will be rejected. Next, decide on your match and safety schools as if the reach schools don't exist. If you implement this strategy, you will be more likely to select match and safety schools you actually like instead of just settling.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Do not listen to the people who say you are an automatic admit to every school.</strong></p>
                            <p>This tip is mostly for URMs (underrepresented minorities), legacies, first generation students, and students from poor backgrounds. People will tell you that you will DEFINITELY get into [insert name of prestigious school] because people like you are in demand, sometimes get in with lower grades and SATs, and provide diversity. Do not believe these people. I will not deny that some groups of students do have an advantage, but nothing is guaranteed. I am a URM with three ivy rejection letters. People told me that since I am a high achieving URM, I could get in anywhere. This just isn't true. I know of other students with hooks who were rejected as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Know what you want, and do not compromise.</strong></p>
                            <p>Has your dream been to live in a city? Apply to city schools! Have you always wanted to be an engineer? Apply to schools with highly ranking engineering programs! Is a small environment a must for you? Then apply to small LACs, and forget about the big universities.</p>
                            <p>Do not compromise when you apply to schools. Figure out what you want, and continue searching until you find it. You should not end up in a situation where only your dream school has the qualities you are looking for. Every school should. Seriously, do not compromise. Keep looking until you find schools that you absolutely love.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Do not let one bad visit deter you from applying.</strong></p>
                            <p>Just because your tour guide sounded elitist or the admissions officer gave a bad presentation does not mean that you will not love the school. Do not start to hate a school because of one person you were not fond of. If you live nearby, visit the school again. (I did this once, and I ended up applying in the end.) If not, spend time on the website and look up reviews about the school online. Do not simply rely on your first impression.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Read a book about admission to selective colleges.</strong></p>
                            <p>They have good tips that you might not have thought of.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Do not be upset about a lukewarm interview.</strong></p>
                            <p>I thought that one admissions officer disliked me, but she actually loved me! I found out from faculty members that she advocated for me often during the process.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Do not retake standardized tests a million times.</strong></p>
                            <p>If you are in the right range, do not retake the test. This is just my personal advice. Yes, a 2400 is better than a 2200, but don't stress yourself out about the testing so much. Do not let it consume you because testing is no fun.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Rejoice in every acceptance.</strong></p>
                            <p>Rejoice in every acceptance because you don't know what is coming next. Your match and safety schools will probably notify you before your reaches. When the first acceptances start rolling in, start to celebrate. You got into college! Always remember that what you consider to be a match or a safety might be someone else's dream school.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>This is the most important tip. Getting into an ivy will not change your life!</strong></p>
                            <p>At the end of the college admissions process, I did get into one ivy league school. While receiving my fat envelope was one of the most exciting moments of my life, it has not changed me. I am still the same person I was before I received the envelope. I am not smarter or more talented. By this point, the initial excitement has started to wear off. I am so busy studying that I do not have time to think about college 24/7. Getting into a top college/university will NOT change your life. You will be fine either way.</p>
                            <p>Phew! Those were my top ten tips! Best of luck, and may the odds be forever in your favor!</p>

                </div>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <h3><strong>By A ThinkIVY Alumni (2013)</strong></h3>
                        <hr />
                    </div>
                    <p>Let me tell you something. Everyone wants to look brilliant and versatile. I mean who doesn't want to tell the admissions officer that they are everywhere in the community and have taken a phenomenal amount of interest in extracurriculars.</p>
                    <p>The plan to talk about specific ec's rather than all of them is still much more efficient. Here's why. An admissions officer simply has to look at your ec files in order to determine whether or not you have been involved in the community. You don't need to write an essay and specifically tell him about your numerous community activities in order for him to butter him up about your "versatile" skills.</p>
                    <p>Almost everyone who applies to these top schools has pages and pages of extracurricular activities. You're not the only one who has been extremely "versatile" as a high school student. Thousands of students clearly want their ec's to stand out; they are all going to be indicated them in an essay and have their counselor's recommendation include those numerous activities they have done outside of school.</p>
                    <p>This conveys a message to the admissions officer that you are certainly involved in the community. So the admissions officer will say "this kid right here is not someone who limits himself to school and academics. He certainly takes part in the community and that is a good thing."</p>
                    <p>However, <mark>if you really want your admissions officer to ADMIRE you (in other words want your folder to truly stand out); you've got to show your personality as not just involved, but truly passionate and real. What this means is</mark> that you won't seem like just a application folder anymore; instead you seem much more animated and creative - in short, much more human and real. This is what separates you from that other kid who also had the same, long list of ec's.</p>
                    <p>How does one do this? How does one show their personality like this? The only real choice that you have is through your essay. Some might say interview. Well, most schools actually place much more importance on your essay than your interview. The reason is simple: Your essay is your only communication medium inside that committee room. Only one person interviews you but everyone reads your essay. It is the only way that you speak and show your feelings and creativeness. Your essay can be an amazing asset.</p>
                    <p>By picking specific ec activities and talking about them; your writing prose and content go much deeper and beyond the superficial areas.</p>
                    <p>As a result, you won't seem like a kid trying to impress an admissions committee about how versatile you are. Instead, you will convey something deeper and more meaningful to them: your livelihood and passions. When you focus and narrow down on a topic and speak about yourself very experiences very deeply; it shows your feelings, thoughts, and ideas so much more. It makes you seem so much more human and real; not just as an application folder sitting in front of their eyes out of the thousands! It makes you more unique and real in front of their eyes.</p>
                    <p>I have had many friends with tons of ec activities and 4.0 GPA along with a very rigorous curriculum and a good SAT score get rejected from places like Dartmouth, UPenn. After all these years (I'm now at one of the top engineering schools in the country), my friends and I realize why we got rejected from certain places we tried to get into back then. We just never conveyed ourself enough to the admissions committee.</p>
                    <p>Here's the deal. Think of it as two different cases.</p>
                    <p>Case # 1) This kid named Jill has her list of ec activities and talks about how she is very versatile and yada yada.... She also relists most of his ec activities in an essay of its own.</p>
                    <p>Case #2) This kid named Jenny has the same list of ec activities. Instead of listing all the activities over again in another essay, she picks one activity that she felt the most passionate about. Jenny than goes very in depth and talks about her feelings and experiences about that one activity. She even talks about how it has helped her be a slightly different person in life. How it has helped her to look at things in a different and more optimistic perspective and than Jenny backs this up by listing the specific events in that one activity that really impacted her.</p>
                    <p>To me, Jenny shows much more of his personality than Jill. I really didn't need Jill to re-list all her ec's and I feel that Jill is trying to FORCE IT. She's trying too hard to get the admission's admiration and that is just pathetic. Goodbye Jill.</p>
                    <p>Jenny on the other hand has done a superior job of conveying her personality and experiences. She did not seem like she was forcing it across. It is clear that Jenny is not trying hard to capture anybody's attention; she is simply speaking about who she is and how she feels about life. This person has much more of an impact on me than Jill.</p>
                    <p>Jill is just one of the thousands of applicants who seem like they really, really want in this college. That's all I can say about her other. She may have good grades and good test scores but thousands who apply to these top schools have those same credentials; Jill just is not standing out in her application to me.</p>
                    <p>Jenny is someone who I can visualize as a real person outside of her material application file that I'm holding. That coupled with good grades and SAT scores and recommendations presents a MUCH stronger file than Jill's. She isn't perfect but she is someone who the admissions would take very seriously. Chances are in her favor that they will take her.</p>
                    <p>Get the point?</p>

                        <h3><strong>Sheryl T</strong></h3>
                        <h4>ThinkIVY Mentor (Penn '15)</h4>
                        <hr />

                    <p><strong>General</strong></p>
                    <p>Know what makes an applicant impressive, and understand the Failed Simulation Effect. In short, if you can get the admissions officers to ask themselves "How the heck did did a high school student do that?" you've made yourself an interesting applicant. <mark>It's not about getting perfect grades and scores all the time; if you accomplish something genuinely beneficial and out of the ordinary, you're golden.</mark></p>
                    <p><strong>Essays</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Be interesting. Admissions officers are interesting people who are bored and maxed. They want to read interesting essays. They want to find interesting people to populate next year’s freshman class. The beauty of the fact that they are looking for interesting people is that once you have become an interesting person, you simply have to be yourself in your essays. You don’t have to pretend anything.</p>
                    <p>2. Show interest. This is particularly applicable to top, but not the best, universities. Every year, colleges fight to protect their so-called yield, which is basically how many admitted students end up going to their university. The yield is important because it helps to determine the college’s ranking. When they have over 30,000 students to choose from, they'reonly going to take the students that they think will attend to protect the yield. This means that when you’re writing your essays, make sure to demonstrate interest. Be specific about why you want to attend the school.</p>
                    <p>3. Find your voice. Do not write like a dead fish that was robotic to begin with. Instead of talking about yourself and the things you did (and invariably sounding like an arrogant prig), reveal through vivid and specific examples why the things you like to do are awesome. While no rule is absolute – the only absolute goal in college applications is the intended impression – voice is essential to maintaining the vivacity of your essays. Doing it right: "Imagine playing chess while simultaneously running a marathon with a pack of wolves pursuing you. The game is called Squash and it’s a sport for multitasks."</p>
                    <p>Side note: the handwritten message on my Stanford acceptance letter commented, of all things, on my writing voice. While I can't pinpoint any single thing as the cause of my acceptance, I'm certain that a unique, passionate voice helped my chances immensely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Prove yourself. Your goal in the college interview is to prove that you are an interesting and engaging (and cool, friendly, positive) person; as with the rest of your application, you want to come across as someone they would find it fascinating to go on a cross-country road trip with.</p>
                    <p>2. Show who you are. Talk about projects you've worked on, research you've done, internships you've had caught, classes you've taken, revelations you've had, philosophical concepts you've stumbled upon, books you've read, interesting recent developments in the news that provoke thought, trends in modern society; steer the conversation towards items you can talk about.</p>
                    <p>3. Bring your enthusiasm. The interviewer asks you about your life and achievements plus your interests, philosophies, and aspirations. For most of the process, the best preparation is to simply be enthusiastic about life as you travel through it. Don't lose your exuberance to nerves on the threshold of the coffee shop or cafe</p>

                    <p>Be an active participant in your college visits. Instead of just attending, listening, and walking around, get a small notebook just for visits and write down at least five things you like about the school and five things you don’t like about the school. You can also refer back to these notes should you need to write a supplemental essay asking "Why this college?".</p>

                    <p>Ask teachers for recommendations prior to the end of junior year, before they leave for the summer. Some teachers limit the number of letters they will write each year, and this is a way to make sure you’re not out of luck come the fall. Others might use the summer to write in support of you while their work with you is still fresh in their minds.</p>

                    <p>The essay is the part of the application over which you have the most control. Use it! Spend some real time thinking through your topic. Are you sharing something important about yourself with the admissions committee? Are you telling a story anyone could tell, or is it specific to you? Have you highlighted a way in which you will add to the campus community or something about yourself that is unique? The more time you take to think through what you will write about, the more likely your essay will positively impact your chances of being admitted.</p>

                    <p>Listen to your gut. You'll hear lots of "talk" during this process — whether it's from parents, friends, kids at school, or well-meaning adults. In the end, YOU are the only one who has to attend the college you choose and you need to make that decision based on what your gut says is the right place for you.</p>

                    <p>If you are an athlete looking to play your sport in college, make sure you are registered on the NCAA website by spring of your junior year so that coaches can access your athletic and academic profile.</p>

                    <p>Think about how you learn best when determining your ideal college. Do things "click" for you when discussing ideas with other students, listening to a lecture, studying on your own in the library, or experimenting in the lab? Make sure there is a good match between your preferred learning style and what the college offers.</p>

                    <p>Look closely at the testing requirements for each of the colleges you are considering applying to and make sure you have a plan to complete all of the necessary tests in time.</p>

                    <p>When planning your college visits, do your research. Look on the website for clubs you'd join if you were a first year student, and email the president or outreach coordinator and ask to sit in on a meeting or event. During the visit, be your most outgoing self. Talk to every person you can. Conducting informal "person on the street" interviews in an elevator or in line in the dining hall may tell you more in five minutes than an hour with a tour guide. Ask: What's your major? What other colleges did you look at? Would you make the same choice now? If you could change one thing about the college, what would it be? The answers will give you great information about campus life.</p>

                    <p>It's easy to find reach schools you love, and often to find match schools too, but it's just as important to identify two safety schools that will be good, solid fits. You also need to show interest in those safeties (e.g. request information via their websites, attend local rep visits, visit the campus, etc.) prior to applying so the admissions committee will see you as a serious applicant.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>When visiting a college, don't focus on superficial qualities like how nice the residence halls are. Instead, think about whether the students at the school are people with whom you want to spend the next four years of your life. If you like your roommates and the people who live in your residence hall, you'll have a great time no matter if your room is big or small. And the most luxurious room imaginable won’t make up for attending a college where you don't connect with the other students.</p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>1) Admission Test Scores Versus Grades</p>
                    <p><mark>Everyone knows that the safest position to be in when applying to college is to be a student who has BOTH high test scores and good grades from high school. What do colleges say about what they are looking for when they can't get both?</mark></p>
                    <p>Over and over and over, what college admissions officers claim to look at most closely as the main admission factor is a student's "transcript." Note that the word is "transcript," NOT "grade average." A Yale admission officer says, "We will look holistically; we will look at everything in your application. . . . We look at how much challenge you have provided yourself." An MIT admission officer says, "What correlates best with grades in the junior and senior years of college is taking the toughest courses in high school. Most students admitted to MIT have a healthy mix of A's and B's." A Duke admission officer says, "Duke asks the question, 'How have you challenged yourself?'" A Harvard admission officer says, "The most important is high school courses and grades. Take good, tough courses. We can tell if you are not challenging yourself." The Harvard viewbook (page 47 of this year's edition) says, "The Admissions Committee recognizes that schools vary by size, academic program, and grading policies, so we do not have rigid grade requirements. There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them." Another Harvard admission officer says, "We're trying to understand your high school. A grade of B+ is not the end of the world. We want to know how you avail yourself of resources. It's our job to understand the different high schools in our area."</p>
                    <p>A high grade average is NOT impressive if it is gained by taking wimpy courses. One of the Harvard admission officers says, when asked about weighted versus unweighted grade averages, "When I see a grade average like 6.85, the first question I ask myself is, 'What does this really mean?' I look at the rest of the applicant's file and especially at the applicant's activities to find out if the applicant is the real deal." A Vanderbilt admission officer answering a similar question says, "The G.P.A. has become the most meaningless number in college admissions." Don't hunt for a high G.P.A. at the expense of avoiding intellectual challenge in your course selection and extracurricular involvements--that won't fool anyone.</p>
                    <p>If you are a high school senior, make sure you are keeping up in all your hardest courses. Senior year grades DO matter. If you are a junior, plan to take the most challenging courses you can and take those courses seriously. If you are younger, plan to meet the prerequisites for the toughest academic path at your school and look for opportunities to self-study or to take summer courses to get ready for tougher academics as you get older. All colleges expect all applicants to submit COMPLETE transcripts for all secondary level or college-level courses the applicant has taken anywhere. A college admission office will consider what courses you have taken even if you haven't had those courses recorded on your main high school transcript. If you have high grades, even if you have low test scores, consider retaking your tests, but meanwhile apply boldly to a range of colleges of varying selectivity.</p>
                    <p>Colleges look at standardized tests as the one thing that is comparable among all applicants. A Harvard admission officer says, "There are a lot of A's; test scores help us distinguish among applicants." Admission officers claim to consider your test scores in light of your family socioeconomic background and home language and other factors. If you have high test scores, even if you have low grades, work on building up your grades, but meanwhile apply boldly to a range of colleges of varying selectivity.</p>
                    <p>"Superscoring" SAT scores or ACT scores (taking the highest section scores from different administrations of the test and combining those for admission consideration of each applicant) matters much less than students think. Superscoring is only beneficial if you have some ups and some downs on section scores between two sessions of the test. If you go up on all sections, your better scores are considered, period. NO college regards your lower scores more than your higher scores, whatever order your scores came in, if all the scores are from the same session of the test. Superscoring ONLY matters if a student has an increase on one section but a decrease on another as two sessions are compared. All colleges always give students the benefit of their highest scores, at least as to comparing sessions (in whatever order the test sessions occurred) and as to comparing brands of tests (the ACT is not preferred to the SAT, nor the other way around).</p>
                    <p>Never take a standardized test without taking it seriously. Always use the sample test you get when you register for a test (most students can get free sample SAT or ACT tests from their high school counseling office, or online) under actual test time-limits, and learn the timing and style of questions on the test before taking the test for keeps. Check your answers from the sample test and analyze what mistakes you made. You can do best on a test by being relaxed and confident and not worrying too much about your score. ALL colleges in the country, without exception, admit students who made mistakes on some test questions. Harvard's viewbook says, "Harvard does not have clearly defined, required minimum scores".</p>
                    <p>Even if your test scores AND your grades are in the middle-to-lower range, apply to one or two "reach" colleges for you that you like. Emphasize your other desirable characteristics on your application. You just might get in, and you can only get in if you apply.</p>
                    <p>ALL applicants to ALL colleges need to send official ACT or SAT score reports to the colleges that request scores. Colleges don't think what you self-report or what may be written on your high school transcript is an official report of your scores. Designate recipients of official score reports from your testing organization before you take the test, if you are taking the test as a senior. Don't put yourself under deadline pressure by putting off reporting the scores.</p>
                    <p>2) Reporting AP and IB and SAT Subject Test Scores</p>
                    <p>A few colleges require applicants to submit SAT Subject Test Scores. Those should be sent directly to the college on an official report from the College Board. Take SAT Subject Tests seriously. A Harvard admission officer says, "Standardized tests are comparison tools. The better predictors are SAT II Subject Tests and AP tests. They are more important than the SAT I or the ACT. You may have read that colleges are expressing doubt about standardized tests, but I'll give you a clue: We won't be cutting back on tests. We might require five SAT II tests. Those are less coachable than the SAT I. Working hard as a student is more important than taking tests." From the New York Times:"Although coaching would no doubt continue if subject tests replaced the SAT, at least students would be focused on content as much as test-taking strategies, Mr. Murray said. There would also be pressure to improve local high school curriculums so that students were prepared, he wrote.</p>
                    <p>"These arguments make sense to Mr. Fitzsimmons [dean of admission at Harvard], who said, 'People are going to prepare anyway, so they might as well study chemistry or biology.' He added that 'the idea of putting more emphasis on the subject tests is of great interest' to his group."</p>
                    <p>For years some colleges have asked students to self-report AP test scores or IB test scores on their application forms, and beginning in 2008, the Common Application has lots of space for students to self-report AP (or IB) test scores for all the applicants to all of the hundreds of colleges that use that application form. Self-report your scores--all of them. Anyone who has an AP or IB score to self-report from junior year or earlier when applying to college is in a good position when applying to college. Colleges are going to see every which possible combination of scores, high and low, and it will generally be better to have scores to report than not to report any scores at all. You only need to send an official score report to the one college that admits you, but self-report those scores to all the colleges that ask about them on their application forms.</p>
                    <p>3) Self-identifying with an Ethnic Group</p>
                    <p>All colleges everywhere claim to cherish diversity, and whatever your background, there will be many colleges that will welcome you to enroll. But don't miss the chance to explain what other forms of diversity you bring to each college. An admission officer from Duke says, "We are looking for truly diverse students--and I'm not just talking about ethnicity--with a wide range of interests, who in the future will succeed in many different occupations." So mention any unusual place you have lived, any unusual hobby you have, any unusual career goal you are pursuing, and anything that makes you different from other applicants. Take advantage of every college's pursuit of diversity.</p>
                    <p>4) Financial Aid as an Admission Barrier</p>
                    <p>Some colleges definitely depend on tuition payments by students as their main source of revenue.</p>
                    <p>Maguire Associates - Services - EMPROVE: Pricing Optimization and Value Enhancement</p>
                    <p>If the college raises its tuition by $10,000 per year, and then starts offering its top students $8,000 per year merit scholarships, maybe those students aren't really getting such a great scholarship. Some colleges may not admit you unless they think you can pay most of the cost of attending from your own funds. I'm still trying to find out if colleges mostly prefer to admit wealthier students.</p>
                    <p>Scholars are still investigating this issue. But some colleges claim to be "need-blind" in admission, and you might as well put those colleges to the test, especially if you need a lot of financial aid to go to college and are worried about being admitted. Apply to a wide range of colleges, from colleges with a low list price to colleges that are famous for providing lots of financial aid and not considering need for aid as a barrier to admission. Once you get admission offers from all the colleges you can, then compare offers. Don't take colleges off your application list too early.</p>
                    <p>5) Recommendation Letters</p>
                    <p>Remember to provide each teacher from whom you ask for a letter of recommendation some written information about yourself, so the teacher has something to adapt into the letter, the forms the college asks the teacher to fill out, addressed envelopes and postage, and plenty of time to write the letters. Teachers are busy. Letters of recommendation are not a right of every student but a privilege teachers grant to their better students.</p>
                    <p>6) Interviews Are Important</p>
                    <p>Interviews are only rarely a make-or-break aspect of a college application, so don't worry about your interview, but do take the opportunity to be interviewed if that is offered. An MIT admission officer recommends that you get an interview from each and every college that offers an interview. MIT applicants who accept interviews have a much higher base acceptance rate than applicants who decline the opportunity to be interviewed. In most college interview situations, the interviewer becomes your advocate to the admission committee. Relax and be yourself.</p>
                    <p>7) Make Your Essays Personal</p>
                    <p>A Duke admission officer said in September, "It's September; please start your essays NOW if you haven't already. The essay has to be your best writing. We receive more than 20,000 applications a year, so we've seen it all. We can tell when an essay has been written by an adult. Your distinctive voice makes an essay stand out." A Harvard admission officer said, "It's always nice to read a well-crafted application essay. Write about what is important to you. Give yourself at least a week to write and rewrite your essay." At two other moments in the same information session, that Harvard admission officer said, "We read applications in the order in which they are received beginning on the 1st of December. The earlier 250 applications are more exciting to read than the later 1,000." [there were laughs from the audience] and "I read about 1,200 essays last year. But I enjoy the last 250 less than the first 250, unless something really sings out." Not all colleges read applications in the order they are received, but don't take so long to write your essay that you put things off to the very last minute before the deadline. A Vanderbilt admission officer says,"Your essay is an important part of your application. Everything else is someone else talking about you; your essay is your chance to tell us who you are.</p>
                    <p>"Always be yourself. Always talk about yourself. If I cross out your name and dump all the essays on the floor, anyone should be able to pick out your essay. Write in your own voice."</p>
                    <p>One specific tip is to show your essay to two different people. One should know you very well, and comment on whether or not your essay sounds like the real you. The other should not know you well, and comment on how your essay makes you look to an unfamiliar reader.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Let me start by quoting James Carvel who once said “There’s the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Which do you want?”</p>
					<p>I can’t give you “nothing but the truth” simply because I don’t have access to it. No one does.  And I can’t give you the whole truth both as I cannot speak for the full range of application readers and I can’t speak for the policies and practices of thousands of colleges and universities. Instead, what I can give is a bit of the knowledge I have of what some schools do and what I myself did reading applications over many years. My answer, then, is limited, but I do think that what I will say might be applicable to more than just my own point of view, but I can’t back this up with quantifiable data.</p> 
                	<p><strong>Fast Reads</strong></p>
					<p>There are actually several versions of what I call fast read applications. The first applies mostly to highly selective schools, but does filter down to the others too.</p>
					<p><mark>Among a group of 20,000 applications there are going to be some students who did not quite get the memo about finding schools within a realistic range.</mark> These students apply to some of the most selective schools in the world even though their academic credentials are, if not downright weak (there are a few of these too), then they’re at least not even close to the profile of admitted students. With websites like Parchment, students can easily get a good idea of their chances of being admitted. There really is not much of an excuse any more for submitting applications to schools with little or no chance of getting in. (There will always be pressure from parents or the students themselves, however, that impose a willful blindness, despite the data.) A student who is not close to the numeric rubrics is more often than not going to get nothing more than a cursory read of his or her essays. Some schools or some readers won’t even bother.</p>
					<p>The other group of fast reads comes from the opposite end. There are a number of students who have submitted numbers that are so strong that the essays won’t have much bearing either as these schools (usually not at the top of selectivity) take virtually everyone who has demonstrated they can achieve success via the numbers and academic program. Some of these schools may not get 20,000 applications but many of them do as they are often State Schools with large numbers of in state applicants and those students have have done everything right and as residents won’t have to do a Proust to get in.  To support my assertions I will quote Mitchell Stevens, whose book on admission, Creating a Class,  is quite good. He knows how the process works based on spending time in an admission office. He has recently addressed the essay issue in The New Republic:</p>
					<p><i>Applications with clearly high or low composite metrics, relative to the college’s overall applicant pool, were ruled on quickly. It was the files in the messy middle of each year’s applicant pool, whose numbers made them neither obvious “admits” nor clear “denies,” that got more extensive attention. Yet even in these middling cases, personal essays rarely got even cursory attention from admissions officers. There were simply too many files to consider in too small a time frame, and too many other evaluative factors that mattered much more. How likely was an applicant to accept our offer of admission? Had we already accepted anyone from his or her remote zip code? Had the applicant received any special endorsement from a college alumnus or a faculty member? Did someone in the office owe a favor to the applicant’s guidance counselor? Those are the questions that get debated before a verdict is reached. But during the hundreds of deliberations I sat in on over two admission cycles, I literally never heard a decision made on the basis of a personal essay alone.</i></p>
					<p>Another way to approach your question is to frame it from the other side. If you were an admission officer and you opened up an application on your computer the first things you generally look at after the basic information contained on the Common App (and almost all schools that get 20,000 apps use Common App) is the testing and transcript. If a student is not in the top 20% of the class and has scores a couple of hundred points below the mean would you as a reader who has a huge number of applications stacked up spend a lot of time reading the essays? Honestly? Really? Even if you say yes, I would want to ask the same question after you had been doing this day after day week after week month after month. While stats can be deceiving they can be useful too. Students who are not close to the numeric rubrics of highly selective schools virtually never, ever get in unless they are a special (athlete, development case, under-represented student etc.). A typical student who is white or Asian who is not at or even well above the average set of scores with a great program, and great grades has almost no chance of getting in to the most selective schools. Let’s just say, however, there is a student with a set of essays so wonderful that if a reader would mull them over they might try to make a case to look past a low set of numbers. Now comes the pragmatics of a cost benefit analysis. If a school misses out on one great writer how much of loss is it to the school. If the school has to hire more readers in order to insure that all application essays are read carefully in order to find one or two a year is it worth it? If a reader has to put in many, many more hours reading over each application slowly is it worth it to them to put in overtime to do so? If a school misses one or two great voices each year will it hurt the quality of the class. And most importantly, there are many great colleges and universities and if the student does not attend one there will be many others instead.</p>
					<p>Let me end, however, with a description of one of my heroes in admission. She read applications for over 20 years and having watched her do this I can vouch for the fact that she gave every single student a close read. It did not matter the numbers the student presented. She felt this was only fair. She spent untold extra hours doing this. She had virtually no life except for her reading during many months. She has now retired but her example made me try to give more time to applicants who otherwise would have been signed off on perhaps a bit too quickly on my part. I can’t say in all honesty that I still did not employ some fast reads, but I tried to give anyone who was moderately in the running a fair shot. I can’t always say I got everything right, but it wasn’t for lack of effort or concern for the time, interest and work that students put into a far too stressful process.</p>
					<p><strong>Slow Reads</strong></p>
					<p>Students who have the numbers, program, scores strong recommendations, activities that predict involvement out of the classroom, get a slow read. But slow needs to be put in context. To read 650 words (the limit for the Common App prompt) does not take more than a few minutes. Some schools have supplemental essays but usually no more than one or two and these often have much shorter word limits. All told then it is unlikely that it takes more than 10 minutes to read all the words a student has submitted For those students who have spent countless hours fretting over picking a topic, brainstorming, writing draft after draft after draft, editing and getting feedback and doing final edits this may seem like a shockingly small amount of time.</p>
					<p>Think of it this way. If you read a piece by a respected journalist or academic or anyone else that is published in places like the New Yorker or some other place how much time do you spend reading it. More often than not, it does not exceed the time admission readers put in reading student essays. Admission readers are trained to read and many have a background that prepares them for distinguishing quickly between good and bad writing. The cliché of choice in admission is that reading applications is an art, and this is somewhat accurate, but there should also be some science too. Applicants who write about research using details should know that readers have some familiarity with the kinds of things that student are doing. Some of these things are more impressive that what undergraduate students are doing and some kind of knowledge about the world that is being described in words is useful. Readers then get educated at least to be good generalists. They see thousands of essays if they have worked for a few years and they see that many fall into genres. It gets easier to pick those who come near the top of genres--for example, the "I have overcome much" essay or "I am poetic and creative" essay or "I have started my own business" essay etc. I always found it fun to try to fight for students who were as they say on the cusp. Those students who might not have quite the same numbers as others but had a voice that I was sure would add to the class.</p>
					<p>My belief in and comments on an essay's strengths that went to the rest of the committee did not always mean these students got in; my heart was broken sometimes when others did not agree with me, but I cannot say I have the ‘truth’ when it comes to knowing all things about students or essays. As I have written a great deal about essays on Quora and my blog I won’t go further into the mechanics of what makes a great essay here. Instead, I will end with this piece of advice.</p>
					<p>If you have put a great deal of effort into your essays, then the experience itself will transcend whether you get into a certain school or even if a person read your essay quickly or slowly. Learning how to write is a skill that will help you once you are at your college or university and well beyond that too. Even if the essay is not a huge factor in many admission decisions, the skills you will have will follow you wherever you go. Best of luck.</p>
