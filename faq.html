                        <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Author: Jenny F</strong><br /><small>Former Admissions Officer at MIT, Harvard, Michigan</small></h3>
                        <hr />
                        <p>Many - but not all - colleges are trying to figure out just how interested a student might be in attending their college. <mark>When an admissions committee can't admit everyone, it is helpful to have some sense of the seriousness which which a student might consider an offer of admission.</mark></p>
                        <p>Meaningful contacts are ones in which the student learns about the school (which the colleges hope will make the student even more intersted) and/or ones that show a student's sincere interest in the institution. For instance, visiting a college is one of the best ways to learn about a college. Similarly, interviewing on campus or signing up for an interview with an alumnus/a in a student's area (assuming interviews are available) are great ways to experience an institution and/or engage with someone from the community in a meaningful way. During those interviews, students can ask questions, learn great information, and start to get a sense as to whether or not the college may be the right fit for her/him.</p>
                        <p>If a student can't get on campus or if interviews aren't available, perhaps having a substantive conversation with a college representative at a college fair or reaching out to an admissions officer via email to ask serious questions (after one has done a little bit of his/her own homework on the school) would be a good idea. Sometimes colleges offer Skype interviews if distance or cost prohibit a campus visit. Or, social media or other modern technology offer opportunities to engage with admissions bloggers or other current students.</p>
                        <p>The point is that talking with someone in the admissions office can be really important when conduct one's search and trying to figure out what colleges would be a great fit academically, extracurricularly, and financially.</p>
                        <p>Please note, though, that college admissions officers generally don't want students to contact them if they don't have real questions to ask. There is a line to walk between contacting a college/talking to a college's representative and contacting/talking to that person too much or without a real reason to do so.</p>
                        <p>One final note: if a student would apply to a college and be deferred (meaning that the admissions office wants to wait a little bit before making a final decision on the student's application), it is imperative that the student reach out to the admissions office to express a continued interest in being considered for admission. Responding graciously and maturely after a deferral is yet another important way to have meaningful contact with an admissions officer.</p>

                        <p><mark>I wouldn't say it's common practice to expect a first draft, and if I'm a 17-yo student applying to college, this might even intimidate me.

                        <p>For a counselor, you might include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a few words to describe your personality</li>

                        <hr />
                        <p>Addressing a low GPA can be tricky. If something was happening in your life that negatively impacted your GPA, it may be important share this information with the admission committee in the “additional information” section of an application (or as an addendum to your application or in an interview). However, just because your GPA is lower does not automatically mean you should talk about it.</p>
                        <p><mark>Whether or not you address the situation can depend on a lot of circumstances. Was there something happening in a particular semester/year, and were your grades clearly lower during that time period? If yes to both, then</mark> you probably want to address it. Sometimes students will have something happen in a particular semester, but their grades remained consistently average. In this scenario, it is difficult to address the lower GPA because there is no noticeable change.</p>
                        <p>The types of situations that are commonly shared on an application include (but are not limited to) a parental divorce, death in the family, bullying, learning disability, medical problem, or taking a class for which you did not have the adequate prerequisites. Admission officers realize that teenagers have a lot on their plates and sometimes there are things outside of their control that can impact academic performance. If you encountered a situation like this, you should definitely address it.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not you have encountered a situation like this, the difficulty with addressing poor grades, is that you don’t want to sound like you are making excuses. It is important to take responsibility for your academic standing while also shedding light on the additional circumstances.</p>
                        <p>If your GPA is lower because you were not doing your homework or putting in the necessary effort, this is difficult to address. Here is the good news: it is not too late to start working hard right now. Your goal should be to knock your senior year grades out of the park and finish with your best academic performance ever. You can also help your chances for admission with strong standardized test results. Admission officers are not cold-hearted people who are looking to deny every student. They want to find reasons to admit students, so go out there and give them a reason by getting it done in the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as a senior, you may not be able to “right the ship” in time to receive serious consideration at the ultra-selective colleges or universities (those that are admitting less than 20% of their applicants). However, those colleges make up less than 1% of the colleges, universities, and degree granting institutions in the United States. The overwhelming majority of colleges or universities (which includes countless numbers of outstanding institutions) will gladly admit a student with an average overall GPA and a positive trend in their grades (and/or a strong standardized test result).</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is also important to be honest about your chances for admission. You can still apply to a couple ultra-selective institutions, but make sure you have a wise application strategy that includes a handful of colleges where you have a stronger chance for admissions. If you are looking for some of those colleges, check out the website Colleges That Change Lives as well as any number of the outstanding state institutions across the country that do not fit into the ultra-selective category.</p>

                        <p>In general, the best applications unfold, with each aspect (transcript, recommendations, activities, essays) adding something new to your application. In some cases, that can be different views of one aspect of your life--for example, a musician who writes one essay about mastering a difficult piece, and another about learning how to teach another person how to play. This would be the same theme, but each essay would have a different impact. Or, if your "I want to go to your college because..." essay is about the superb scientific opportunities at the college, and your essay is about your first experience with lab research, that is fine too.</p>
                        <p><mark>Try to stay away from deliberately hammering away at just one aspect of yourself, though. Very often, students who had heard "you need a hook to get in to college" would try to create a hook for themselves by relentlessly promoting one achievement.</mark> More often than not, this would backfire because other parts of the application were more interesting to the committee, but there wasn't information there about anything but the self-selected hook. The more aspects of yourself you are able to highlight, the more opportunities you have to connect with various members of the admissions committee.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <p><mark>As a former admission officer at Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, and Bowdoin, I can tell you unequivocally that your essays are crucially important in the admission process.</mark></p>
                        <p>A few thoughts:</p>
                        <p>Think of the essay as an opportunity to add something different/unique to your application, aside from your grades, test scores, activities, honors, etc. Try not to repeat information that can already be gleaned from elsewhere in the application. If you are elaborating on a particular activity or academic goal, describe a particular aspect or instance that one might not have considered from assessing your transcript or activities list.</p>
                        <p>Have a story to tell about your background, your personality, your goals, your growth and development? Great! Any anecdotal information you can write about will capture the admission officer’s attention and lend texture to your application.
                            Brainstorm ideas, write an outline, use bullet points, then write a rough draft. Get your top ideas down on paper, then write the essay around them. It makes the process a little less daunting than feeling you need to sit down and write an entire essay from scratch.</p>
                            <p>Edit, edit, edit! Don’t just write one draft and think it’s finished. Show it to people you trust, get their opinions, then go back and make changes. This should be a process of personal discovery as well as an effort in writing a succinct, grammatically correct, informational, and interesting composition.</p>
                            <p>Answer the question asked! Don’t think that "One essay fits all." Different essay questions require different responses.</p>

                            <p>These tips are mostly geared towards students interested in applying to very selective colleges, but I think that they can be of use to everyone.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Limit the number of reach schools on your list!</strong>
                                    <p>I personally think that you should limit the number of schools you apply to with acceptance rates under 15%. I know that some people apply to all eight ivies hoping that they will get into at least one. I understand where these people are coming from, but I do not think that this is a good strategy for a few reasons. 1) There is no way you are in love with all eight ivies. They have distinct personalities. 2) Think of the number of essays you will have to write. It is better to write three good essays than 10 mediocre ones. 3) Unless you are a transcendent student (by ivy league standards), chances are that you could end your senior year with many rejections. That is just disheartening.</p>
                                    <p>As for me, I applied to five reach schools. Four were ivies. I was accepted to two of my reach schools and rejected by the other three. I do not think that five reach schools is a terrible number, but I would not do it again. I only applied to two of the ivies because of their prestigious names. I spent a lot of time on the applications, and then I was rejected in March! It just is not worth it. I would recommend 1-3 reach schools that you LOVE.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Craft your college application list as if the reach schools did not exist.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>This is something I did, and I would recommend this tip to everyone. Select your 1-3 reach schools, and then forget about them. Assume that you will be rejected. Next, decide on your match and safety schools as if the reach schools don't exist. If you implement this strategy, you will be more likely to select match and safety schools you actually like instead of just settling.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Do not listen to the people who say you are an automatic admit to every school.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>This tip is mostly for URMs (underrepresented minorities), legacies, first generation students, and students from poor backgrounds. People will tell you that you will DEFINITELY get into [insert name of prestigious school] because people like you are in demand, sometimes get in with lower grades and SATs, and provide diversity. Do not believe these people. I will not deny that some groups of students do have an advantage, but nothing is guaranteed. I am a URM with three ivy rejection letters. People told me that since I am a high achieving URM, I could get in anywhere. This just isn't true. I know of other students with hooks who were rejected as well.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Know what you want, and do not compromise.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Has your dream been to live in a city? Apply to city schools! Have you always wanted to be an engineer? Apply to schools with highly ranking engineering programs! Is a small environment a must for you? Then apply to small LACs, and forget about the big universities.</p>

                            <p>Do not compromise when you apply to schools. Figure out what you want, and continue searching until you find it. You should not end up in a situation where only your dream school has the qualities you are looking for. Every school should. Seriously, do not compromise. Keep looking until you find schools that you absolutely love.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Do not let one bad visit deter you from applying.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Just because your tour guide sounded elitist or the admissions officer gave a bad presentation does not mean that you will not love the school. Do not start to hate a school because of one person you were not fond of. If you live nearby, visit the school again. (I did this once, and I ended up applying in the end.) If not, spend time on the website and look up reviews about the school online. Do not simply rely on your first impression.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Read a book about admission to selective colleges.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>They have good tips that you might not have thought of.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Do not be upset about a lukewarm interview.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>I thought that one admissions officer disliked me, but she actually loved me! I found out from faculty members that she advocated for me often during the process.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Do not retake standardized tests a million times.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>If you are in the right range, do not retake the test. This is just my personal advice. Yes, a 2400 is better than a 2200, but don't stress yourself out about the testing so much. Do not let it consume you because testing is no fun.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Rejoice in every acceptance.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Rejoice in every acceptance because you don't know what is coming next. Your match and safety schools will probably notify you before your reaches. When the first acceptances start rolling in, start to celebrate. You got into college! Always remember that what you consider to be a match or a safety might be someone else's dream school.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>This is the most important tip. Getting into an ivy will not change your life!</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>At the end of the college admissions process, I did get into one ivy league school. While receiving my fat envelope was one of the most exciting moments of my life, it has not changed me. I am still the same person I was before I received the envelope. I am not smarter or more talented. By this point, the initial excitement has started to wear off. I am so busy studying that I do not have time to think about college 24/7. Getting into a top college/university will NOT change your life.You will be fine either way.</p>

                            <p>Phew! Those were my top ten tips! Best of luck, and may the odds be forever in your favor!</p>
